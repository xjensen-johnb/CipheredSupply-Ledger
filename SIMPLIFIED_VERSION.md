# Simplified Supply Ledger - Optimized FHE Implementation

## Overview

The SimplifiedSupplyLedger is an optimized version of the CipheredSupplyLedger contract that reduces encryption time from 80+ seconds to approximately 20-30 seconds by encrypting only the 4 most critical parameters.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Reduced Encrypted Parameters
- **Original**: 9 encrypted parameters (weight, volume, value, quantity, temperature, humidity, fragility, priority, risk)
- **Simplified**: 4 encrypted parameters only
  - `weight` (euint64): Shipment weight in kg
  - `value` (euint64): Declared value in USD
  - `quantity` (euint32): Number of items
  - `risk` (euint8): Risk assessment code (0-5)

### 2. Performance Gains
- **Encryption time**: Reduced from 80+ seconds to ~20-30 seconds (â‰ˆ70% reduction)
- **Gas usage**: Significantly reduced due to fewer FHE operations
- **Transaction success rate**: Improved by reducing complexity

### 3. Plaintext Parameters (MVP)
The following parameters are stored in plaintext for this MVP version:
- Temperature requirements
- Humidity requirements
- Priority score
- Cargo category

## Deployment

### Deploy the Simplified Contract

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simplified.js --network sepolia

# The script will output the contract address
# Save this address for frontend configuration
```

### Test the Contract

```bash
# Set the contract address
export SIMPLIFIED_SUPPLY_LEDGER_ADDRESS=0x...

# Run the test script
npx hardhat run scripts/test-simplified.js --network sepolia
```

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Update Environment Variables

Add to `webapp/.env`:
```env
VITE_SIMPLIFIED_SUPPLY_LEDGER_ADDRESS=0x... # Your deployed contract address
```

### 2. Use the Simplified Hook

```typescript
import { useSimplifiedSupplyLedger } from '@/hooks/useSimplifiedSupplyLedger';

const {
  submitShipment,
  startTransit,
  markDelivered,
  fetchShipment,
  fetchSupplyStats,
  isReady,
} = useSimplifiedSupplyLedger();
```

### 3. Submit a Shipment

```typescript
const shipmentData = {
  shipmentId: uniqueId,
  carrier: "0x...",
  receiver: "0x...",
  // Only 4 encrypted parameters
  weightKg: 1000,
  declaredValue: 50000,
  quantity: 100,
  riskCode: 1,
  // Plaintext parameters
  temperature: 273,
  humidity: 50,
  priority: 500,
  category: 'Electronics',
};

await submitShipment(shipmentData, (progress) => {
  console.log(progress); // Track encryption progress
});
```

## Contract Functions

### Core Functions

- `submitShipment()`: Submit a new shipment with 4 encrypted parameters
- `startTransit()`: Update shipment status to InTransit
- `markDelivered()`: Mark shipment as delivered
- `markLost()`: Mark shipment as lost
- `assessRisk()`: Perform FHE-based risk assessment

### Admin Functions

- `authorizeCarrier()`: Grant carrier permissions
- `addInspector()`: Add quality inspector role
- `revokeCarrier()`: Remove carrier permissions
- `removeInspector()`: Remove inspector role

### View Functions

- `getShipmentInfo()`: Get shipment details
- `getSupplyStats()`: Get supply chain statistics
- `isCarrier()`: Check if address is authorized carrier
- `isInspector()`: Check if address is inspector

## Gas Optimization Details

### Encryption Operations (per parameter)
- euint64: ~40,000 gas
- euint32: ~35,000 gas
- euint8: ~30,000 gas

### Total Gas Usage
- **Original (9 params)**: ~400,000 gas for encryption operations
- **Simplified (4 params)**: ~145,000 gas for encryption operations
- **Reduction**: ~64% gas savings

## Migration Path

### From Full Contract to Simplified

1. **Deploy SimplifiedSupplyLedger**
2. **Update frontend to use new hook**
3. **Test with reduced parameters**
4. **Monitor performance improvements**

### Future Enhancements

Once FHE performance improves, you can:
1. Add more encrypted parameters gradually
2. Implement batch encryption when available
3. Use Gateway decryption for public outputs

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Transaction still reverting
**Solution**: Check that you're using the SimplifiedSupplyLedger contract and hook, not the original

### Issue: Encryption still takes too long
**Solution**: Ensure you're only encrypting 4 parameters, not 9

### Issue: Contract not found
**Solution**: Verify the contract address in your .env file matches the deployed address

## Development Commands

```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy simplified version
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simplified.js --network sepolia

# Test the contract
SIMPLIFIED_SUPPLY_LEDGER_ADDRESS=0x... npx hardhat run scripts/test-simplified.js --network sepolia

# Run frontend with simplified contract
cd webapp
npm run dev
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Original | Simplified | Improvement |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Encrypted Parameters | 9 | 4 | 56% reduction |
| Encryption Time | 80+ seconds | 20-30 seconds | 70% reduction |
| Gas Usage | ~400k | ~145k | 64% reduction |
| Transaction Success Rate | Low | High | Significant improvement |

## Security Considerations

While this simplified version stores some parameters in plaintext for the MVP, the critical financial and risk data remains encrypted:
- **Encrypted**: Weight, Value, Quantity, Risk (business-critical)
- **Plaintext**: Temperature, Humidity, Priority (less sensitive for MVP)

For production deployment, consider:
1. Gradually adding encryption to more parameters
2. Implementing role-based access control
3. Adding Gateway decryption for authorized parties
4. Implementing audit logs for all operations

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the test script output for detailed error messages
3. Ensure you're connected to Sepolia network
4. Verify FHE coprocessor is available at the configured address
